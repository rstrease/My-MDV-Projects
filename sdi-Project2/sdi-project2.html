<p>My day of fishing starts out by determining what location I want to go to and at what time I want to set out. Then I check the weather forecast to see if fishing is doable. Once I arrive at the location I choose the right bait for the setting, tie it on the line, and cast it out into the water and wait for a fish to bite. I try and catch my limit of 5 crappie and 6 bass for a total of 11 fish. When I reach my limit it is time to pack up and head home for a fish fry.</p>
